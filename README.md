🎬 Movie Recommendation System using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how to build a Movie Recommendation System using machine learning techniques, specifically Collaborative Filtering with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The system provides personalized movie recommendations based on user ratings, making it ideal for applications like streaming platforms.

📌 Objective
The goal of this project is to recommend movies to users based on their viewing history and the preferences of similar users.

🗂️ Data Source
Movies dataset: Contains information about movie titles and genres.
Ratings dataset: Contains user ratings for various movies.
🛠️ Tech Stack & Libraries
Python (Google Colab for development)
Pandas for data manipulation
NumPy for numerical computations
Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
Scikit-learn for K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model
Google Colab for collaborative development and fast computation
⚙️ Key Features
User-Item Matrix: Build a matrix where rows represent users and columns represent movies, with ratings as values.
Collaborative Filtering: Use KNN to find similar users and recommend movies that those users have rated highly.
Data Visualization: Visualize rating distributions and popular movies.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model’s performance using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).
🔍 Project Overview
Data Preprocessing: Merging datasets, handling missing values, and creating a user-item matrix.
Collaborative Filtering: Using K-Nearest Neighbors to find users with similar tastes.
Modeling: Train-test split of the user-item matrix and fitting the KNN model.
Evaluation: Calculate the RMSE to evaluate the model’s accuracy.
Movie Recommendations: Recommend movies based on nearest neighbors’ preferences.
🚀 Usage
To get movie recommendations for a specific user, simply run the system and provide a user ID. The model will find similar users and recommend movies accordingly.

📊 Future Work
Implement Content-Based Filtering to recommend movies based on movie genres and features.
Explore Matrix Factorization techniques like SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) for better accuracy.
